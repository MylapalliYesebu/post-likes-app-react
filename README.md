# ⚛️ Post & Likes App

This is a **mini-project** built as part of the  
**[UI Developer Training Program](https://github.com/MylapalliYesebu/UI-Developer-Training-Projects.git)** (Phase 2),  
a CSR initiative of **Infosys Foundation** at **Ideal Institute of Technology**.

## 📋 Description

The **Post & Likes App** is a simple **ReactJS** application designed to demonstrate key **React concepts** like **state management**, **props**, and **real-time UI updates**.

In this app, users can view multiple posts and click the **Like** button to increase the like count instantly. The app updates the UI dynamically without reloading, showing how **React state** and **component-based design** work together efficiently.

An extra feature allows users to add their own posts, which appear immediately in the list — showcasing how React handles user input and component re-rendering.
